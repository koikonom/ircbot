IRC Bot... (yeah very inspired title) 

* Requires txmongo (https://github.com/fiorix/mongo-async-python-driver/)

A small irc bot that logs URLs posted in a IRC channel and store them in a mongodb. 
It will also:
    * download and store any images mentioned in the channel.
    * store quotes 
    * whatever...

How to run:
$ python ircbot.py <server> <channel> <nickname>
